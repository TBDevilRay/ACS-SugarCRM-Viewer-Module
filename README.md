# ACS-SugarCRM-Viewer-Module
The ACS Viewer Module replaces the default behavior of downloading a file when a file link is clicked within the SugarCRM Document module. Instead, the file selected is displayed within Accusoftâ€™s ACS Viewer, and of course, the option to download your document is preserved.
